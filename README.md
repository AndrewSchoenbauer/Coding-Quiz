# Homework-4
For this assignment, we were tasked with making a quiz that had a timer, and multiple questions. At the end of the quiz, you were prompted with your score, and to add your initials. After submitting, you were presented with a high score screen that displayed that high score, and other scores you have gotten. This assignment took a long time to really figure out the direction  I wanted to go, but once I got a base, it became a little easier. 
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to create this quiz. The most interesting part of this project for me was all the functions that needed to be made, just to do a couple things. It ended up being a lot more complicated that I anticipated.
